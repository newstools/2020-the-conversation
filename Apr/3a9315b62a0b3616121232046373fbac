Since South Africa has been placed in lockdown to limit the spread of COVID-19, many people have been panic buying and stockpiling groceries. As a result, many of the grocery stores in the country have some empty shelves. Questions about whether South Africa will run out of food have been doing the rounds. To address these questions, Professor Johann Kirsten, director of the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University, chats to Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa. They look into food production, supply chains and the impact of the lockdown on the affordability of food for many poor people. Photo:
