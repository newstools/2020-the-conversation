Many African countries now require people to wear a mask when out in public. This is part of the effort to stop COVID-19 from spreading. Cloth masks reduce the number of droplets that are spread into the environment when people breathe, cough or sneeze. Medical masks protect the wearer from these droplets. Itâ€™s important to wear and remove a mask properly. Marc Mendelson, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, demonstrates mask techniques and explains how people can protect themselves and healthcare workers.
