Following over two weeks’ protest against police brutality in Nigeria, there are reports that a number of protesters have been shot with live ammunition. Reports suggest that unarmed protesters were shot by military men at the Lekki toll plaza in Lagos on Tuesday, October 20.

He also talks about how to make its replacement unit function effectively while checking human rights abuses and corruption in the police force. Read more:
